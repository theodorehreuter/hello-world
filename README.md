General Storage and Starting Out

My Name is Theo

I have webbed toes, and came of age in an asylum. The only other kid was a frog kid.  They made him practice sweeping up sawdust so he could work in the sawmill.   When I left, all the kids called me Frankie Donkey Brains, so I had to get a certificate stating that I did not have donkey brains.  And I ask you this Dennis?  Do you have any such certificate?

RUM HAM!
